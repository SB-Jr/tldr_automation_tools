# Docker

## Main Uses

- Build reproducible environment

- Declare the dependencies in a YAML file with proper versions to maintain uniformity across environments

- Create a scalable, reliable cluster that can run the entire project across a fleet of heterogeneous machines.

## When not to use Docker

- **Not a Replace of VM:**
  
  Even though docker provides a container like VMs but it is not supposed to replace a VM.  Docker can be though used as a VM alternative, it is just difficult to maintain such containers. 

- **State Management**:
  
  A VM provides features like saving state and resuming from the last state as if the VM was never shut down, whereas in case of Docker, its primary focus is to provide a uniform way to reproduce a working environment with least amount of variables defined. It thus lacks the feature of VMs out of the box.

- **Multiple Services**:
  
  Another thing is that docker is supposed to be containing only 1 service in it and its dependencies. And separate services are supposed to installed in separate docker containers. And these services should communicate with others through a private network rather than using system calls. Thus the services should be designed in such manner. Trying to use it for services designed tightly coupled with others or heavily depending upon the system for the mode of communication should not be used with a docker and rather should be used inside a VM.

## The Architecture

Docker uses a client/server architecture where the docker engine acts like a server, running in background, caching images and managing the containers and the containers acts as the clients consuming the docker engine services.

## Components in Docker

- `Dockerfile`: source code

- `Image`: binary result when we compile a `dockerfile`.

- `Container`: running instance of an image.

- `Registry`: it is similar to a package repository containing multiple docker images, which can be pulled or managed like we manage packages using apt, yum, npm, yay, etc.



## The `Dockerfile`

It uses a simple syntax to express the steps that should be taken when building an image out of it.

> Note: Any command that is written inside a dockerfile is executed inside an empty container and the intermediate state of the container after the execution of the command is stored. So if we have 4 commands, there will be 4 intermediate states, each command being executed on top of the previous generated intermediate state and the final intermediate state is stored as an image.

eg:

```docker
FROM ununtu
RUN echo "First Docker Image"
```

- **FROM**: tells docker to copy the base image of the latest ubuntu image in this case.

- **RUN**: tells the docker to perform an action when creating generating an intermediate state.

To build this image we use the command:

```bash
docker build /path/to/dockerfile
```

the output is of this format:

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.048 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu

Step 2 : RUN echo "My first Docker image"

My first Docker image
 ---> 1d4302baa251
Removing intermediate container f85bd2e0f554
Successfully built 1d4302baa251
```

- Step 1: It is fetching the latest ubuntu image and downloading it into the local machine.

- Step 2: It is running the RUN command inside a container and then showing the output when doing so.

If we look closely, there was an intermediate state generated after the `FROM` command was executed and it was later deleted when another intermediate state generated from the `RUN` command was successful.

As we have not provided a name to be given to the last successful generation of intermediate state, it provides a unique hash value and outputs that hash value. To provide a name we will use the `-t` flag while building the `dockerfile`.

```bash
docker build /path/to/dockerfile -t <image-name>
```

running:

```bash
docker run <image-name>
```

### The `CMD` Command

There is big similarity between the `CMD` and the `RUN`command. Both are used to run a command inside the container. But the main difference lies in -> when will the command will be run. If we want to run a command during the creation of the image (like initializing the environment or the first one time setup when the image will be created ) we will need to write the command in the `RUN` section. But if we want the command to be run when we load the image inside a container (like starting a server) we need to write it withing the `CMD` section.

So anything written with the `RUN` command will be creating an intermediate state of the image and that image will be stored, but anything written with the `CMD` command will not be generating an intermediate state and will be executed when we will run the image in a container.

### The `WORKDIR` Command

This states the directory a user will be using when he enter the container to interact with it.

### The `copy` Command

To copy a certain file inside the docker from our local machine we will use the `COPY` command to do so.

eg:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu
WORKDIR /tmp
COPY /path/to/file .
RUN <some-arbitary-command>
```

Here the `COPY` command will copy the file to the current directory as we used the `.` to mention it. The current directory is currently the `/tmp` directory which was changed by the `WORKDIR` command.

Here the output will be:

```bash
Sending build context to Docker daemon 3.072 kB
Step 1 : FROM ubuntu
 ---> 104bec311bcd
Step 2 : WORKDIR /tmp
 ---> Using cache
 ---> 8b7569f87645
Step 3 : COPY test.txt .
 ---> c515890976fb
Removing intermediate container 7d07b7f6f0fb
Step 4 : RUN cat test.txt
 ---> Running in 9ec4a66f5a05
I'm the content of test.txt
 ---> 27922b2708f1
Removing intermediate container 9ec4a66f5a05
Successfully built 27922b2708f1
```

As we can see there was 4 steps executed and 4 intermediate states generated which were later removed when the next command was successfully executed.

### The `ENTRYPOINT` Command

As we saw the `CMD` and `RUN` command, the `ENTRYPOINT` command is also similar. It will execute a command during the starting of an image as a container. 

We will see the main difference later when we discuss the running of an image.



## Useful Commands

### Listing Images

To list all the images that the docker is currently aware of in the local machine we can use the `images` command. It will output the 'Repository' , 'TAG', 'IMAGE ID', 'CREATED' and 'SIZE' of each image.

eg:

```bash
$: docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
test                latest              f2aba921b459        2 minutes ago       129 MB
```

### Running an Image

To run a specific image as a container we will need to use the `run` command.

eg:

```bash
$: docker run test
```

This will only run the docker image as a container but will not let us interact with it. By default any image is run in the 'daemon' mode as opposed to 'interactive' mode.

### Interacting with a Container

To interact with a container we will need to use the `-it`  flag. But just the flag is not enough, we will also need to provide an application that we want to interact with. This application can be any application that we have installed in it during the creation of the docker image.

As we have used the base ubuntu image for the creation of the image, we can interact with any application the ubuntu contains by default, eg: bash.

eg:

```bash
$: docker run -it test bash
```

But as this process is the only process running inside the container, thus it will be given the PID as 1.

But as here we have specifically used the `bash` application to run inside the container, the command specified in `CMD` wont be executed. `CMD` command is only executed when running the container without specifying any applications. This is where the `ENTRYPOINT` command comes into picture. The command specified in `ENTRYPOINT` is executed irrespective of the application which we have asked the container to execute.

> Note: The image, when we run as a container will execute the `CMD` commands and will stop as soon as the commands finish executing. It wont be alive to take in further commands, to make it running we will need to specify a command that keeps it alive like 'bash' in our example.

> Note: The entry directory of the container will be '/tmp' as we had changed the entry directory using the `WORKDIR` command.

The bash prompt will look something like this:

```bash
root@<some-hash>:/tmp#
```

Certain thing to **Note** here:

- The user is `root`  as we have not mentioned to create any other user during the generation of the image.

- The hostname is not a fixed string and will keep changing as we exit and rerun it again in interactive mode.

- The docker container is basically a system process which uses your system resources. 

- Any changes we make in the docker container are not saved and the moment we exit it, everything is reset back to the initial state i.e. containers are by default stateless.

- The ubuntu image here used is not exactly the regular image used for installing on a server or on a host machine, it is basically a stripped down version which provides only bare applications which are needed for it to function as a ubuntu container.

- Docker assigns a random name to each container instant running so that we dont need to refer to it by its id hash value.

### List currently running containers

We can use the `docker ps` command with additional flags to list the docker containers running at the moment. We can also use the `-a` flag to print the docker name with the other information. 

### Saving a docker state

We can use the `docker commit <docker-container-name> <image-name>` to commit the changes made inside a container as a new image.
